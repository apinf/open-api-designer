## How to run 

Make sure you have main.db in same directory and be sure it has correct right. In linux, you can do this by running:
```
touch main.db
chmod 700 main.db
```
### Init the database

Simply run init.py:

```python3 init.py```

Now the database is inited, you can move to running the actual program.

### Run the program

Simply run main.py:

```python3 main.py```

**Note!** main.py doesn't yet do anything usefull, but in the future it will do something and it will be documented here.
